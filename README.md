I am a content curator, passion activator and starting to live my best life by being a lifetime learner in everything people and tech. While I am not fluent in the "language" of tech, I can hold a conversation in "tech", build a website using html, css and javascript.  What's next....cleaning up what I have hapazardly done so far and learning any and everything I can about AI.

- 👋 Hi, I’m @jenhill7
- 👀 I’m interested in program management & business development in the technical world.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to code because I believe you communicate better when you can understand and speak the language, or at least have an understanding of it.
